1. Pick any token that'll make you rich AF (trust those degen instincts)
2. Ape into that juicy bonding curve like it's the last DIP
3. Sell whenever to claim your lambo (or ramen, no judgment)
4. When 70% of tokens swap for 3.5 ETH, bonding curve hits 100% (it's math, don't ask)
5. 25% of that sweet liquidity gets yeeted to UNISWAP and burned (anti-rug technology, son)
6. 5% of remaining tokens gifted to the luckiest degens (could be you anon)
